COMPANY: CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS 

NAME : M Hajiya Jasmine

INTERN ID: CTO4DF753

DOMAIN: Frontend Web Development

BATCH DURATION: 4 WEEKS

MENTOR NAME: NEELA SANTOSH

DESCRIPTION:

Objective:
The main objective of this task is to build a personal portfolio site that includes all necessary sections like Home, About Me, Projects, and Contact, with smooth navigation. The portfolio should be visually appealing, easy to navigate, and fully responsive across different devices such as desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

Technologies Used:

HTML: Used for the structure of the webpage.
CSS: Used for styling, layout design, colors, spacing, responsiveness, and visual aesthetics.

Features Implemented
1. Responsive Navigation Bar:
The website includes a fixed navigation bar at the top with smooth scrolling to different sections of the page. The navigation links include Home, About, Projects, and Contact.
2. Home Section:
This is the landing section of the portfolio. It contains the developer’s name and a short professional title such as “Frontend Developer”.
3. About Section:
This section contains a brief introduction about the developer, highlighting skills, interests, and what drives them to build web applications. It serves as a way for viewers or potential employers to learn more about the person behind the portfolio.
4. Projects Section:
A simple layout listing two projects is included. Each project has a title and a short description. This section can later be expanded with real-world projects, GitHub links, or project screenshots.
5. Contact Section:
A basic section showing the developer’s email address is provided. This allows visitors to reach out for opportunities, feedback, or collaborations.
6. Footer:
The webpage ends with a clean footer that includes a copyright.

Design Highlights:
The color palette uses a mix of dark and light tones for contrast and clarity.
Text is kept readable with good font choices and spacing.
Each section is clearly divided and organized for better user experience.
The website is responsive and adjusts to different screen sizes.
CSS Flexbox is used to align elements properly across the layout.
Smooth scrolling behavior is enabled for a better browsing experience.

Conclusion:
This task was an excellent opportunity to practice front-end skills and create a functional and presentable portfolio. It not only helped me in organizing my past projects in one place but also gave me a practical understanding of how to build user-friendly interfaces using just HTML and CSS. This portfolio can be used in job applications or internship opportunities, and it serves as the foundation for a more dynamic website in the future.
